# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Implementation



## Description



This project contains Python implementations of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm in a recursive manner to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph. Unit tests are also included to verify the correctness of the implementation.



## Requirements



- Python 3.x



## Installation



1. Clone the repository:



    ```

    git clone https://github.com/christineparry9/floyds-algorithm.git
